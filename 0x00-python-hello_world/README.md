# ðŸ‘‹ Python - Hello, World!  
It's our first project in high-level programming with Python! In this project, we will cover the basics of Python programming, its syntax and get introduced to some fundamental concepts like the use of strings, indexing, slicing, the official Python coding style and how to check our code with [pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/), and also, how to use the python interpreter etc.  
## Learning Objectives ðŸ“š
This project aims to get us acquainted with the below objectives:  
* __Why Python Programming is Awesome__: Understand the reasons why Python is a popular and versatile programming language.  
* __What is the Zen of Python__: Gain insights into the guiding principles and philosophies that shape the Python community, known as the __Zen of Python__.  
* Learn how to use the Python interpreter to execute Python code interactively.  
* __How to Print Text and Variables using Print__: Master the print function to display text and variables in the console.  
* __How to Use Strings__: Understand the concept of strings, a fundamental data type in Python, and learn how to manipulate them.
* Explore how to access individual elements (indexing) and subsequences (slicing) of strings and other data structures.
* __What is the Official Python Coding Style and How to Check Your Code with Pycodestyle__: Familiarize ourself with PEP 8, the official style guide for Python code, and learn how to use pycodestyle to ensure our code adheres to the recommended style.
