# Python-Data_Structures â‹†Ëšâœ©â‹†
In this project, we are meant to discover why Python programming is highly regarded and the benefits it offers. We will delve into the intricacies of lists and tuples, two versatile data structures that play a crucial role in Python programming. Upon completion, we will be acquainted with the below objects:
## Learning Objectives ðŸ§  
Throughout this project, we'll work towards achieving a comprehensive grasp of Python's power and versatility. Our exploration will include but not limited to:  
* Understand the concept of lists, how they store multiple values, and how to create and manipulate them.  
* Analyze the differences and similarities between tuples and lists, highlighting the ways they handle data storage and manipulation.  
* Master the most common methods associated with lists, such as `append()`, `insert()`, `pop()`, `remove()`, and indexing, and comprehend how to effectively utilize them.  
* Implement lists as both stacks (Last-In-First-Out) and queues (First-In-First-Out) and recognize their practical applications.  
* Grasp the concept of list comprehensions, a concise way to create lists based on existing sequences, and effectively use them in our code.  
* Understand tuples as ordered collections similar to lists, but immutable, and become proficient in creating and manipulating tuples.  
* Differentiate between tuples and lists by considering their mutability and specific use cases for each data structure.
* Utilize the `del` statement to remove elements from lists and understand its implications on data structures.
### Task module
  |Files|Tasks|
  |:----|:----|
  |0-print_list_integer.py|a function that prints all integers of a list.|
  |1-element_at.py| a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.|
  |3-print_reversed_list_integer.py| a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.|
  |4-new_in_list.py|func that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C)|
