# If-Else Statements, Loops, and Functions üí´  
This project is tailored to provide us with a solid understanding of key concepts in Python programming, specifically focusing on if-else statements, loops, and functions.  
## Learning Objectives üß†  
The core objective of the task exercises in this directory is for us to gain proficiency in the below listed area:
* Discover the reasons that make Python a powerful and versatile programming language  
* Understand the significance of proper indentation in Python and how it affects code readability and structure.
* How to Use the if and if...else Statements: Learned how to use conditional statements to make decisions in a code.
* Dive into loop structures to automate repetitive tasks in our code (use of while and for loops).  
* controlling the flow of loops using `break` and `continue` statements.  
* Learn about the range() function and how it simplifies working with sequences of numbers.  
* Grasp the concept of functions and how they help organize and modularize code.  
* __Scope of Variables:__ Explore the scope of variables and how their visibility changes in different parts of your code.
* __Understanding Tracebacks__: Learn about tracebacks and how they help identify the source of errors in your code.
* Master the basic arithmetic operators (`+, -, *, /, %`) and their applications in Python.  
### üîç Bytecode instructions contd. (Advanced) üî¨
Understanding the set of instructions that the Python interpreter executes directly. This involves [Disassembling](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/dis.html) bytecode which allows us to see the exact sequence of operations that the Python interpreter will perform when executing our Python code. It can provide insights into how the code is executed and help one understand the underlying mechanics.
